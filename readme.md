# Send to Injective Burn Auction Contract

This repository contains a CosmWasm smart contract that facilitates sending tokens (both native and CW20) to the Injective burn auction subaccount. The contract provides an interface for handling native token transfers and CW20 token operations, ensuring proper routing to the designated burn auction subaccount.


The contract requires the contract address of the INJ CW20 Adapter contract.

## TESTNET DEPLOYMENT
- BURN MANAGER, CODE ID `16122`, contract addr `inj1lxxsj5gs5rxz6r6nhdf8azevfpk2kfukw9su08`
- CW20 ADAPTER, CODE ID `16123`, contract addr `inj1kc8wpmy5pq9hheyvzzwsnu5nqnqtkw83qgzeq2`

## Features

1. **Native Token Transfers**:
   - Accepts native tokens and routes them to the Injective burn auction subaccount.
   - Ensures proper validation of funds.

2. **CW20 Token Handling**:
   - Accepts `send` messages from CW20 contracts.
   - Converts CW20 tokens into a token factory denomination and sends them to the burn auction.

3. **Admin Management**:
   - Allows updating the admin of the contract via an admin-only operation.

4. **Configurable**:
   - The contract's configuration includes the admin address, the CW20 adapter contract, and the burn auction subaccount.
